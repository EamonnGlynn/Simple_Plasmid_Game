# Simple_Plasmid_Game
A fun little game where you play as a bacteria trying collect plasmids and survive
Every 20 seconds new enemies spawn and you must try to avoid enemies that are higher leveled and kill lower level enemies to gain their
plasmids that allow them to consume different sugars
but be careful! more plasmids mean more energy is required to keep yourself alive! have fun and don't hit the white blood cell!
